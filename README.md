# Econometrics

Collection of scrips of econometrical topics and examples 

## OLS
- [ols in R](https://github.com/eal024/Econometrics/blob/master/ols.R)
- [Simulate ols properties](https://github.com/eal024/Econometrics/blob/master/ols_properties.R)

## Difference in difference 
- [Intro to DiD (2X2)](https://github.com/eal024/Econometrics/blob/master/intro_did.R) The basic 2x2 set up. Implementing DiD with `lm()` and with the `fixest` package, and the `felosl()` function. Also, a simple example of the event study setup, using `event()`.
- [Diff in diff in diff]() The intuition for when to use and the setup with base R and the `lm()`.

- [TWFE](https://github.com/eal024/Econometrics/blob/master/twfe.R)  Demonstrate the problem with TWFE (DID) -- taggered treatment. Treatment at different times and with different effects.
