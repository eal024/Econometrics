# data Head Start
# Head Start is a major federally funded preschool program in the U.S.
# targeted at children from low-income parents and provides these children with schooling

# 1) Estimate the effect Pr. of obtaining high school degree w. OLS
model1 <- feols( data = df, highschool_child ~ headstart)
model2 <- feols( data = df, highschool_child ~ headstart + edu_parent)

# Result
fixest::esttable(list(model1, model2))

# Can the estimate be interpreted as causal?
# Should be suspicious. Can be interpreted as causal effect if there is no omitted variable.
# Omitted variable: Variable that is relevant for getting a high school degree and releted to selection into 
#                   into treatment. Since T depend on low-income backgruound, and this must likely is corr. to 
#                   education, OVB is likely.
